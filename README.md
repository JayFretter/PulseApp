# Pulse
A discussion app that allows users to debate various topics by selecting one of an array of pre-defined opinions.

## About
Pulse is a social app designed to allow anyone and everyone to freely discuss and debate topics that are important to them. This is done by creating a new post (called a 'Pulse'), which must ask a question that can be answered with one of at least two predefined options.

For example, a Pulse may ask "Was the new X movie worth the wait?", with possible answers being "Yes" or "No". The Pulse creator could ask a more complex question, however.
