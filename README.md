# Biscuit
A discussion app that allows users to debate various topics by selecting one of an array of pre-defined answers.

## About
Biscuit is a social app designed to allow anyone and everyone to freely discuss and debate topics that are important to them. This is done by creating a new post (called a 'Biscuit'), which must ask a question that can be answered with one of at least two predefined options.

For example, a Biscuit may ask "Was the new X movie worth the wait?", with possible answers being "Yes" or "No". The Biscuit creator could ask a more complex question, however.
