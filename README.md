## About
Pulse is a social app designed to allow anyone and everyone to freely discuss and debate topics that are important to them. This is done by creating a new post (called a 'Pulse'), which must ask a question that can be answered with one of two to four predefined options.

The idea is to encourage thoughtful and civil debate on topics.
- For a user to add their vote, they must outline their reasons for picking their option.
- Users can respond to the arguments of other people in the Discussion section. However, they must first have voted on and reasoned for their opinion.
- A user's vote can be changed at any time if they are convinced by other points of view. To change their vote, they must give a reason for their new vote.
